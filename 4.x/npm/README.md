# arcgis-js-api build tools

These are the recommended dojo build tools for using the [arcgis-js-api](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-js-api) using npm.
You can read more about npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Why
You would use the npm package of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript if you wanted to create local builds of your application.

This can provide an improved debugging experience as you will know which module an error originates from.

## Dojo
If you want to build your application using Dojo, we recommend [grunt-dojo](https://github.com/phated/grunt-dojo) and the included [build.profile](dojo/build.profile.js).
The npm package of the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) is simply a minified version of the API.

The demo Dojo application can be found [here](dojo);
